# Innovation in Real Estate - Fighting Information Asymmetry in the Estonian Real Estate Market

This application has been developed as part of the Horizon2020 Funded [OpenGovIntelligence](http://www.opengovintelligence.eu) Project. This pilot application has been developed by Tallinn University of Technology's [Ragnar Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance](https://www.ttu.ee/institutes/ragnar-nurkse-department-of-innovation-and-governance) in cooperation with Estonia's [Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications](https://www.mkm.ee/en). The purpose of this pilot program is to fight information asymmetry in the real estate market and provide an easy way to access real estate data. The pilot is intended to give real estate agents, property developers, investors, and those involved in the real estate market (buyers, sellers, renters, students, new arrivals etc.) a deeper knowledge of the marketplace.
  

This application has been built through the exploitation of a variety of different open government data sets and provides different information relating to areas within the city of Tallinn, such as:
* Crime data (https://www.politsei.ee/et/organisatsioon/analuus-ja-statistika/avaandmed.dot)
* School locations
* Traffic safety (Data provided from Eesti Liikluskindlustuse Fond for 2013-2016
* Building information (http://opendata.mkm.ee/ehr/)
